# verify-changelog-updated GitHub Action
A simple GitHub Action that runs a sanity check on your PRs to verify that the changelog file has been updated. (If you're anything like me, you may have merged a PR or two while completely forgetting to update the changelog)

## Getting Started
Assuming you have a file named `CHANGELOG.md` within the root of your repository, add the following to a new file `.github\workflows\verify_pr.yml`:

```yaml
name: Run PR Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  check_changelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Verify Changelog Updated
    steps:
    - name: Verify Changelog Updated
      uses: takanuva15/verify-changelog-updated@v1
```
Commit the file and create a PR to `main` - you should see the action run.

## Additional Usage Parameters
There are two additional parameters you can specify for the GitHub action:
- `excused_label`: A label that, when added to the PR, will exempt the PR from needing to satisfy the changelog check.
  - Default is `changelog update optional`
- `changelog_filename`: The name of the changelog file. The GitHub Action will verify whether this file has been updated within the PR.
  - Default is `CHANGELOG.md`

(Both parameters are case-sensitive)

Sample usage:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Verify Changelog Updated
    uses: takanuva15/verify-changelog-updated@v1
    with:
      excused_label: my_custom_label
      changelog_filename: changelog.txt
```
